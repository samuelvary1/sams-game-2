[game needs title]

In this game you play as a Russian soldier (you have 4 to choose from at the beginning of the game) who has gotten separated from their unit in the waning days of World War 2. You must rely on your wits to gather items, pass levels, and make it back to safety in a landscape fraught with peril. 

GAMEPLAY

When you begin the game, it will ask the player to choose a character. You have 4 choices, each with different attributes, strengths, and weaknesses. Your character selection may affect certain key points in the game as you play through the story. 


Things I need to work on / design brainstorming:

1. When the player gets to the choose their character page, there needs to be a 'next / previous' button bar that allows the player to cycle through all 4 characters before making their selection. Each character will need a unique link choose-your-character/1, 2, 3, etc. 
2. When they land on the character they want to play as, there must be a button that says select. Then you begin the game as that character.

Game design:

You wake up in an abandoned apartment, your head throbbing dully. A small candle flickers in front of a mud-spattered window near the door. It appears to be the middle of the night, and you have no idea how you got there. The last thing you remember is advancing through an abandoned city street with your unit when a burst of machine gun fire rang out through the night, slamming you to the ground. 

You reach up and gingerly feel a welt behind your left ear with your fingertips. 'How the hell did that get there..'

[then it should go on to describe a few of the items in your inventory] 

[in every room or location you find yourself in, there should be a button that says 'look around'. This will then give a short but more detailed description of what objects might be in the room, such as a key or a weapon or whatever. You can then type 'take (item)' and it should add that item to your inventory. Then a button for leave room and you go to the next location.]

[every time you enter a new location you should have a button to go back to the previous one]
