[game needs title]

In this game you play as a Russian soldier (you have 4 to choose from at the beginning of the game) who has gotten separated from their unit in the waning days of World War 2. You must rely on your wits to gather items, pass levels, and make it back to safety in a landscape fraught with peril. 

GAMEPLAY

When you begin the game, it will ask the player to choose a character. You have 4 choices, each with different attributes, strengths, and weaknesses. Your character selection may affect certain key points in the game as you play through the story. 


Things I need to work on / design brainstorming:

* When the player gets to the choose their character page, there needs to be a 'next / previous' button bar that allows the player to cycle through all 4 characters before making their selection. Each character will need a unique link choose-your-character/1, 2, 3, etc. 


* When they land on the character they want to play as, there must be a button that says select. Then you begin the game as that character.


* Not sure if I should make a locations table, which will contain the text description of each area, and include the items that the character can pick up from each room. 
	- Might be able to just hard code it in the views. But the player needs a concrete way of being able to pick up items in the room. And the program should reject the action if they try to pick up an item that isn't there. Also, once they pick up an item, it must no longer be available, and obviously now is located in the player's inventory.

* Also need to do 4 character drawings and scan them in.

* Don't need to draw the locations, the descriptions will be enough. 

* Write the story tomorrow. DO NOT make it too complex. Keep it simple (like 5 or 6 locations MAX) and you need to pick up certain items to proceed to the next location.

* You need to focus on the bare mechanics of the game: a player chooses a character, that character has an inventory, which allows them to 'have many' items. They then read the text in each location. Based on the description, the player is able to 'pick up' certain objects and add them to their inventory. Once those objects are in their inventory, they can proceed to the next level.
