			You stand up to take a better survey of the room. A family must have lived here, at least until recently. There's a hearth with a pile of ashes scattered over the brickwork. Among the ashes lie some curled fragments of yellow paper, as though the apartment's former occupants had burned a trove of documents prior to a hasty departure. You lean closer and can even make out a few words, just enough to see that it's in Russian, but nothing more.

The mantle is high enough that it is just beyond your eye-level, but the metallic feel of a key is unmistakable. In your surprise, you knock it to the ground with a resounding clatter. Cursing your own clumsiness, you pray that no one heard.
