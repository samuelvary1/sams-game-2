Chapter 1
---------

Story:

You wake up in an abandoned apartment, your head throbbing dully. A small candle flickers in front of a mud-spattered window near the door. It appears to be the middle of the night, and you have no idea how you got there. The last thing you remember is advancing through an abandoned city street with your unit when a burst of machine gun fire rang out through the night, slamming you to the ground. 

You reach up and gingerly feel a welt behind your left ear with your fingertips. 'How the hell did that get there..'
